I thoroughly enjoyed building this website; it was both a rewarding project and an excellent opportunity to train in React Router. I incorporated my personal design style into various sections, always considering the user's perspective to determine how to enhance the site's user-friendliness. Additionally, I utilized animations to create a smoother experience, ensuring an engaging and intuitive user interface.

One cool feature I implemented for this website is that if you accidentally remove a character from the URL—like navigating to https://fardindevm.github.io/Space-tourism-website/cre instead of https://fardindevm.github.io/Space-tourism-website/crew — you'll be greeted with a visually appealing error page. Feel free to click and try it out!
Hope you like it.
